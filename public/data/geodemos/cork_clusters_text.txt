Cork Geodemographic Tool

Geodemographic classification is a tool that groups spatial units based on socio-economic characteristics. 
The Cork Geodemographic Tool is following the Ireland Geodemographic classification method but focusing on Cork for a better insight. For the Cork Geodemographic Tool, Small Areas are selected as spatial units and 2016 Census of Population results are used for socio-economic components. 
The classifications are the result of similarities found in data through the analysis of 35 different variables under the themes of age and marital status; ethnicity; housing; socio-economic group; education; commuting; occupation type; motor car availability and internet access. 
Every step included in the production of this geodemographic tool is open to all users.
